# CS300 Data Structures and Algorithms

-What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?-
The main problem to solve in this project has been to create an effective program to pull data from a file and push it into a data structure. From this data structure, there is functionality to search for a single item in that data structure as print out a comprehensive, in-order list of all elements within that data structure.

-How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.-
I approached this problem first with analysis of the scale and needs of the project, then to implement it practically. If I were to reverse these, I may have wasted development time on an inefficient or ineffective data structure and resulting search and sort algorithms. Knowing how and why each of the structures worked, I was able to think about how each would work with the idea of the program to compare then eliminate the less effective ones.

-How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?-
I overcame most of my roadblocks through testing and research. When I ran into instances where my code was supposed to be working with what I thought was solid logic, debugging statements and breaks in the code helped find any logic failures. When it came to roadblocks where I simply did not know how to execute something in cpp that I knew how to do in other languages, I researched the syntax for some of those functions in cpp. The main roadblock I did not overcome was when I made my hash table. While I understood the concept of the key value pair, I was unable to fully sort out the logic behind how it worked as a data structure. I ran short on time and was left with a less than functional structure and a slightly embarrassed programmer.

-How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?-
This project reinforced my object-oriented programming practices, in encapsulation especially. It was very good practice in all the concepts and the data structure design had to be adaptable, and was, since when I translated it to the new data type, the code worked perfectly first try. Knowing how the data structures and algorithms worked meant I could ensure they were split in such a way that allowed for increasing functionality. For instance, I had forgotten to include functionality to empty out the tree and the result was when loading the data again, it would add to the existing tree. I was able to add a simple function within the Binary Search Tree class that started at the root and emptied the structure of data and set the root to null. Once this was done, it was a simple function call on the courses BST to empty it out before populating it again.

-How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?-
All the other functions, such as some of the algorithms, adhered to the OOP principles and made the program easy to adapt to adding more functionality. Knowing how each structure and algorithm works also ensures that I can make notes and documentation on the code more comprehensive and ensure future maintainability and readability. Knowing is always half the battle.
