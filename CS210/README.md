This project has been my favorite project thus far in school. It is an Item search system that can be used to look up items and print both a list of items as well as a histogram of stored items.

Post Mortem: -What I did well- I felt as though I did a good job sticking with the 4 major OOP principles. I did well to break up functions for encapsulation. Creating a class leads to future inheritance and polymorphism down the line. All in all, this is a good start to a project.

-What I could do better- I definitely could have spent more time with this and really cleaned up my code. It definitely has the look as though I had bashed my way through it. When it comes to the functions, I can break them up even further to reuse parts or create functions for some of the decorations. I could have saved time on development if I actually would have read the instructions in its entirely. 2D vectors.

Challenges: The most challenging thing was actually working with 2D vectors! I enjoyed it immensely, but it did not find its way into the project as there were requirements for classes. Still a good hurdle to cross now.

Transferrables: I have slowly been creating a library of functions, particularly when it comes to decorating in the console. Line() and its derivatives were reused from another project, but were iterated upon to make them better.

Adaptability: This code should be adaptable as I really forced myself to stick with a general sense for programming. Requirements for functions are fairly loose and should be usable with other code that is adjacent in purpose.
